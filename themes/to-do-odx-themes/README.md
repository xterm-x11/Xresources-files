## Xresources-themes
Themes are mostly taken from here https://github.com/logico-dev/Xresources-themes  
but ugly ones (in my view) were deleted, properly sorted in dark/light, and file names were unified.

### Instalation
Clone this repo and put this line to your ~/.Xresources

`#include "/path-to/themes/theme-name.Xresources"`

then execute your usual `xrdb .Xresources`
